# Turkey Electricity Power Generation

Turkey power plants have been visualized starting from 2010. Number and installed mechanical power of power plants depending on the provinces are accessible with their types. Go to [https://onurhakki.github.io/Turkey-Electricity-Power-Generation/]

### Data

The data were obtained from the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) license inquiry section (only available on Turkish) [1]. Currently licensed power plants were only included in the visualization. Additionally, some of the power plants provinces were missing in the license, therefore they were also excluded.

### Functions

In the study, the number and installed power of power plants belonging to the provinces can be observed on a monthly basis. The total number or the total installed power of power plants can be observed in accordance with the selected graphic type and date.

Coloring scale is given between 1-80 for the number of power plants and 1-8000 for the installed power of the power plant. As numbers increase, colors were designed to be changed from green to red.

The monthly change simulation can be observed by clicking the "Run" button in the lower right corner. "Break" button is used for stop the simulation.

When the provinces are hovered, number of power plant are displayed depending on the selected graphic type. However, more detailed information about power plant types can be accessed by clicking interested province.  In this section, the total number or total installed power in the province and the ratio of this amount to the whole country are shown and the distribution of resource types are visualized.
